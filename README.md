# YouTube Discord RPC
This program scans the titles of all open windows to find any open YouTube tabs, then sets your rich presence in Discord to have details about the video. At the current moment it can only find them if the YouTube tab has focus, (although the browser can be minimized) but there may be a future feature allowing it to scan all open tabs.

# Why use this one?
There are other programs out there that serve a similar purpose to this one, but this one is more effective, and much simpler to use. All you have to do is run the program, and a YouTube icon will appear in your system tray. (At the bottom right of your screen.) Just right-click the icon to start, stop, or exit the program, and it will automatically hide its presence from Discord if it doesn't see YouTube open anywhere. Because of this, there isn't any need for user interaction once it's running! When YouTube isn't open, it lies dormant. When it detects YouTube, it will spring into action and automatically display details about the video in your Discord presence. It even works if the browser is minimized! (Unlike its competitors.) All you have to do is make sure that the tab with YouTube open is the one with focus within the browser.

# Compatibility
This program is compatible with most common browsers, (Google Chrome, Opera & Opera GX, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer) and can also be run on any recent version of windows (yet to be tested). It is also compatible with both 32 and 64-bit systems.

# Features
## (That competitors don't have!)
 - Can detect YouTube even in minimized browsers
 - Runs minimized to the system tray to avoid feeling intrusive
